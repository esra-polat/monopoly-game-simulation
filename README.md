> The monopoly game simulation is coded in Java with object-oriented approaches. It is a term project for my "Object-Oriented Software Design" course. This is a group project and my group friend is @nurdenizcayli. The documents and diagrams we prepared while developing the project are in the design-detail folder.

### REQUİREMENT ANALYSİS DOCUMENT

#### VISION
We imagine creating the game called Monopoly. In the first iteration of Monopoly, we aim to create a login page for the game. According to the game rules, we want to enter the number of squares and tax squares and we want the user/users to choose the player's number between 2 and 8. After entering the number of the user, we expect the users to enter their names and starting money for the game. Then, the game starts, board and their squares are created. For the first iteration, the dice are tossed for each player that players start playing from go square and players moved on the board and their money decreases when they come to tax square. 
For the second iteration, we added electric tax square, water tax square, go to jail square, in jail square, community chest card square and chance card square. In the electric and water tax square, decreases the money of player. Ingo to jail square, the player goes to jail square and in jail square, the player tries to get out of prison. In the community chest and chance card square, the player plays the game according to the card he/she draws.
For the third iteration, we added free parking square, railroad square, purchase and rental square, Bagdat Avenue, Beyoglu Avenue, Taksim Avenue and Istiklal Avenue. In the free parking square, the player waits and does nothing. In railroad and avenue squares, if the player wants to buy this field, the player buys or waits in this field. 

#### PROBLEM STATEMENT
In the first iteration, we aim to create the general structure of the game and move the user’s on the board. When the users move on the board, there will be some optional cases that will be left to the initiative of the user. Therefore, the game will not automatically be complete. For instance, buying a house, using a chance card when you are in jail, etc. In the first iteration, there will be just moving on the board. However, during the game, there will be optional cases.
In the second iteration, specific frames have been added to the game. For instance, electric tax square, water tax square, go to jail square, in jail square, community chest card square and chance card square. Now the game proceeds according to the rules in these squares.
In the third iteration, new specific frames have been added to the game. For instance, free parking square, railroad square, purchase and rental square, Bagdat Avenue, Beyoglu Avenue, Taksim Avenue and Istiklal Avenue. Now all squares are added and the game is completed.

#### SCOPE
The monopoly game has different kinds of squares on the board to provide continuity in the game. In the starting, a dice tournament happens and the order of the players is determined. Before starting the game, a desired amount of money is disbursed to the players. The players can use this money to buy avenues and rent them. During the game, there will be many cases to reduce the money of the player and determine the winner. Despite that, the player can earn money from the avenues and each time he/she passes the starting point. The players also pay tax for Utilities as avenues. When the player has less money than the tax, he/she goes bankrupt and loses the game. Until one player who is the winner 
stands in the game and other ones go bankrupt, the game continues.

#### SYSTEM CONSTRAİNT
Will run within a Java IDE environment and therefore require no additional software to be installed on a client machine Will not provides a Graphical User interface.
