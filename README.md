# monopoly-game-simulation
The monopoly game simulation is coded in Java with object oriented approaches. It is a term project for my "Object Oriented Software Design" course. This is a group project and my group friend is @nurdenizcayli. The documents and diagrams we prepared while developing the project are in the design-detail folder.
